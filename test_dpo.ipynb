Substituting in the given values, you can write P = 2 * 25 + 2 * 15. P = 50 + 30 = 80. Therefore, the perimeter of the garden is 80 feet.

Solution: To find the length of each side of the cube, you can use the formula V = s^3, where V is the volume and s is the length of each side. Substituting in the given value, you can write 216 = s^3. To solve this equation, you can take the cube root of both sides, so you can write s = cuberoot(216). Using the cube root property, you can write s = cube root(6^3). s = 6. Therefore, the length of each side of the cube is 6 feet.\n",

      "Bengay is a topical pain reliever that is used to relieve muscle and joint pain. The active ingredients in Bengay are methyl salicylate, menthol, and acetylsalicylic acid. Acetylsalicylic acid is the active ingredient found in Aspirin. It is a salicylate derivative that is used as a pain reliever and anti-inflammatory. It is not the same as methyl salicylate, which is a different salicylate compound that is also used as a pain reliever. Menthol is a cooling agent that is used to help reduce pain and discomfort. So, to answer the question correctly, the correct answer is acetylsalicylic acid. Reference: Bengay label, Aspirin label, PubChem (Acetylsalicylic acid)\n",
