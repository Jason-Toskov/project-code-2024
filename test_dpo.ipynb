Write your code in python. Your code should be agnostic to lower/upper case.<|eot_id|>',\n",
       " 'chosen': '<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nHere is the step-by-step explanation to implement the function `check_words` in Python:\\n\\n1. Define the function `check_words` that takes two arguments: a string and a list of words.\\n2. Convert the input string to lowercase using the `lower()` method to make the comparison case-insensitive.\\n3. Split the lowercase string into individual words using the `split()` method. This will create a list of words from the input string.\\n4. Create a set of unique words from the list of words obtained in the previous step using the `set()` function. This will remove any duplicate words.\\n5. Convert the list of words to lowercase as well to make it case-insensitive.\\n6. Use the `intersection()` method to find common words between the set of unique words from the input string and the list of words provided as input.\\n7. If the length of the intersection is greater than 0, return `True` indicating that there are common words. Otherwise, return `False` indicating that there are no common words.\\n\\nHere is the code implementing the above steps:\\n```python\\ndef check_words(input_string, word_list):\\n    input_string = input_string.lower()\\n    words = input_string.split()\\n    unique_words = set(words)\\n    lower_word_list = [word.lower() for word in word_list]\\n    \\n    common_words = unique_words.intersection(lower_word_list)\\n    \\n    if len(common_words) > 0:\\n        return True\\n    else:\\n        return False\\n    \\n# Test the function\\ninput_string = \"Hello, this is a test string\"\\nword_list = [\"test\", \"sample\", \"hello\"]\\nprint(check_words(input_string, word_list))  # Output: True\\n\\ninput_string = \"This is another test\"\\nword_list = [\"python\", \"programming\"]\\nprint(check_words(input_string, word_list))  # Output: False\\n```\\n\\nYou can test the function by providing different input strings and word lists to see if it correctly identifies common words.<|eot_id|>',\n",
       " 'rejected': \"<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nAs Computer Science Professors, let's dive into the implementation of the `check_words` function in Python:\\n\\nTo begin, we define the function `check_words` that takes two arguments - a string and a list of words. The goal of this function is to determine if the words in the input string have any common words with the list provided.\\n\\nWe first convert the input string to lowercase using the `lower()` method to ensure case-insensitivity during comparison. Next, we split the lowercase string into individual words using the `split()` method, generating a list of words.\\n\\nWe then create a set of unique words from the list obtained in the previous step using the `set()` function to eliminate any duplicate words. We also convert the list of words to lowercase to maintain consistency.\\n\\nUtilizing the `intersection()` method, we identify the common words between the set of unique words derived from the input string and the list of words provided as input.\\n\\nSubsequently, we check if the length of the intersection set is greater than 0. If common words exist, the function returns `True`, signifying their presence. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating the absence of common words.\\n\\nFor practical application, you can test the function with various input strings and word lists to validate its functionality. By doing so, you can observe how the function accurately identifies shared words between the input string and the provided list.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the implementation of the `check_words` function showcases the utilization of string manipulation and set operations in Python to efficiently determine common words between a string and a list, while ensuring case-insensitivity for accurate comparisons.<|eot_id|>\"}"

Substituting in the given value, you can write 216 = s^3. To solve this equation, you can take the cube root of both sides, so you can write s = cuberoot(216).

      "Explanation:\n",
      "Bengay is a topical pain reliever that is used to relieve muscle and joint pain. The active ingredients in Bengay are methyl salicylate, menthol, and acetylsalicylic acid. Acetylsalicylic acid is the active ingredient found in Aspirin. It is a salicylate derivative that is used as a pain reliever and anti-inflammatory. It is not the same as methyl salicylate, which is a different salicylate compound that is also used as a pain reliever. Menthol is a cooling agent that is used to help reduce pain and discomfort. So, to answer the question correctly, the correct answer is acetylsalicylic acid. Reference: Bengay label, Aspirin label, PubChem (Acetylsalicylic acid)\n",
